# Code of Conduct
We're all adults here. Just don't be a jerk. Unless you are really pissed off and have legitimate 
reason to be a jerk. Then you can be a little bit of a jerk. But if you don't feel at least a 
little bit bad after being a jerk, you're probably too much of a jerk and had best fuck off.

Also fuck off if you:
- like offending people a lot
- get offended too easily
- feel an affinity towards coporate structures
- think C++ is a beautiful language
- don't think C is a beautiful language
- are a prude
- write shit code
- use the word "problematic" unironically
- don't use the Oxford comma
- are a Nazi
- don't like spicy food
- like cable news
- didn't cry during that one scene in _Good Will Hunting_
- are a toxic individual
- think that certain words are offensive

Everybody else is welcome.
